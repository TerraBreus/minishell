//personal
added broad goals to roadmap to visualize time spent in different parts of project.
added broad agreements.txt file for standardizing conventions code.
not much documentation has been read as of yet.

//group
read zachaar notes and agree of idea of flaggins types of command with enums
havent yet read links

4/22/2025

//personal
talked with other parsers about what to start on for parse or exec
exec start options
	exit
	echo
	prompt
	signal (ctrl c, ctrl d, ctrl /)

parsing starting options
	is syntax correct
	are quotes closed
	nodes for linked list structure
	env paramaters read or restructure

testing commands to learn how bash works
	learn all 4 redirects
	heredoc
	concectonate or append

//group
make roadmap with clear subgoals
read and borrow documentation

//goal day one
	add libft and headers.									[x]
	tokenize and build struct to save and pass tokens.		[x]

4/23/2025
added first tokenizing file, using libft bonus for making the list.
isnt completed yet so ill make more time to check if the nodes are created in order as hoped.

//goal day 2
	place all seperate words from input in token_list		[x]
	print list to check if tokens and flags applyas intended[x]

nice to have
	operator recognizition (>, <, |)						[x]
	money ($) recognizition									[ ]
	removing quotes from tokens and activating flags		[ ]

#TODO on bigger scale

env variables ($ and $VAR)
merging adjecent quotes (a"b"c -> abc)
recognizing filenames after redirection
heredoc stuff (havent read up about it)

havent started on env knowlegde

operators and tokens are now properly split:
test>test = [test][>][test]
test > test = [test][>][test]

4/25/2025
//personal
fixed empty string quote issue, is now properly recognized
inital creation of tokens is now fixed, checking edge cases and
spotting issues is appriciated

//goals day 4
check syntax of tokens and return error when
outfile is missing											[ ]
quotes arent closed											[x]
pipes not in between commands								[ ]

//not doing heredocs just yet but its lurking on the horizon

4/26/2025
//personal
just gonna rewrite the tokenizer and print function

//goals day 5
token for quotes											[x]
token for variables											[x]
token for operator											[x]

//goals for later
zero -- tokenization is still not correct, fix later		[ ]
echo "hello"world
[echo] ["hello"world]
echo "hello" world
[echo] ["hello"] [world]
first -- properly make word and quote tokens into one		[ ]
second -- check if syntax or sequence of tokens is correct	[ ]
third -- check if outfile is pointing to valid place		[ ]
