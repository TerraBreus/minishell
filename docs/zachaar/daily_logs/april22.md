Cleaned up the roadmap file, even though now I believe it should just be on the main README.md of minishell (which it is and sort of makes the roadmap.md file a bit redundant). In these file I hope to create a step by step guide of how what to do and (hopefully) how to do it. 
Could not get as much done cause of distractions. Wanted to further brainstorm and map on the different topics (in the roadmap) but only got round to (more or less) three topics. Expect to continue on this first thing tomorrow morning.
